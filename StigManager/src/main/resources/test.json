  "requirement-description": "Without establishing where events occurred, it is impossible to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack.\n\nExternal logging must be enabled for WAF data event messages.

  "mitigation-statement": "**Mitigation Statement: A10 Networks ADC External Logging \u2013 STIG A10_Networks_ADC_ALG**\n\nDue to [Clearly state the reason why the STIG requirement cannot be met. Be specific. Examples: incompatible hardware, integration conflicts with existing infrastructure, unavailability of sufficient budget for required infrastructure upgrades, etc.], the requirement to enable external logging for A10 Networks ADC Web Application Firewall (WAF) data event messages via the specified method (direct TCP/UDP logging to a dedicated server) cannot be implemented at this time. This does not negate the critical need for robust WAF logging and analysis. Therefore, the following alternative mitigation strategies will be implemented to maintain equivalent levels of security and incident response capability:\n\n**1. Centralized Log Management System with Enhanced WAF Event Parsing:** We will leverage our existing centralized Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system (specify the SIEM product, e.g., Splunk, QRadar) to collect and analyze WAF logs. This will involve configuring the A10 ADC to forward WAF logs in a supported format (e.g., syslog, JSON) to the SIEM. A custom parsing script or rule set will be developed and implemented within the SIEM to enrich the raw WAF logs, extracting relevant fields for efficient correlation, analysis, and alerting. This script will specifically target and extract data fields relating to attacks, policy violations, and other critical events currently captured in the external logging requirement, thereby providing comparable visibility. Regular audits of parsing effectiveness will ensure data completeness and accuracy.\n\n\n**2. Enhanced Security Monitoring and Alerting:** To compensate for the lack of direct external logging as specified by the STIG, we will enhance our SIEM's alerting capabilities. Specific alerts will be configured based on critical WAF events, such as high-frequency failed login attempts, known malicious bot activity, SQL injection attempts, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and other relevant threat signatures. These alerts will be routed to our Security Operations Center (SOC) through prioritized channels, ensuring rapid response to critical events. The alert thresholds will be refined and adjusted over time based on observed traffic patterns and potential threats.\n\n**3. Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** To mitigate the increased risk associated with the inability to implement direct external WAF logging as prescribed, we will conduct more frequent security audits and penetration testing. These assessments will focus on identifying potential vulnerabilities within the ADC and WAF configurations. The results will be analyzed to inform necessary remediation steps and configuration adjustments. The frequency of these assessments will be increased to [Specify frequency, e.g., quarterly from semi-annually]. Penetration testing will explicitly target the WAF configuration and logging mechanisms, validating the effectiveness of our mitigation strategies.\n\n\n**4. Security Awareness Training:** As part of our layered security approach, regular security awareness training for relevant personnel will be conducted. This training will focus on recognizing and reporting suspicious activity, thereby adding another layer of defense against attacks that may not be immediately detected by the enhanced logging and alert system.\n\n**5. Contingency Planning:** A comprehensive incident response plan will be developed and regularly tested, detailing procedures for investigating and responding to security incidents related to the ADC and WAF. This plan will outline procedures for log analysis, evidence collection, and system restoration in the event of a compromise, providing a framework for efficient incident handling.\n\n\nThese comprehensive mitigation strategies aim to provide equivalent security assurances, despite the inability to fully comply with the original STIG requirement. Regular review and adjustment of these measures will be performed to ensure ongoing effectiveness. A formal risk assessment will be conducted to evaluate the residual risk associated with these mitigated controls, documenting the accepted level of risk.\n\n",
